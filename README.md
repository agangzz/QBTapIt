QBTapIt
=======

Query by tapping (QBT) is the process of identifying a musical excerpt based upon a tapped representation. QBT is a canonical Music Information Retrieval (MIR) task and an intuitive query to perform, yet the literature on this topic remains small relative to other query forms such as singing and humming.

QBT-Extended is a dataset for query by tapping. For further information, see [here](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/qbtextended/).
