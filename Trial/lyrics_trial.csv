Somebody That I Used to Know,Gotye,2012,somebody.mp3,"No you didn't have to stoop so low

Now you're just somebody that I used to know"
You Can Call Me Al,Paul Simon,1986,al.mp3,"If you'll be my bodyguard,

And Betty, when you call me, 
You can call me Al"

Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong"
What's Going On,Marvin Gaye,1971,on.mp3,"Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Ya, what's going on
Ah, what's going on"
